Inspired by the Detective Pikachu movie, I am doing a discovery into Pokemon and their typings! I will try to figure out which type has the most/least Pokemon, the connections between the typings, etc.

Guide for the graph:

1) Each node in the included network is a typing. 
2) The size of the node resembles the number of pokemon of that particular type.
3) The thickness of the edges resembles how many pokemon share the two typings.

Tools used:
	- Python
	- Gephi
